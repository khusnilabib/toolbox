const FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'Do I need to create an account?',
    answer: 'No. All 23 tools work without any account or sign-up. You can start using any tool immediately. Accounts are optional and only add features like history sync and favorites across devices.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are my files uploaded to a server?',
    answer: 'No. All core tools run entirely in your browser using WebAssembly, Canvas, and Web APIs. Your files never leave your device. This is a core architectural principle we call "browser-first".',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Toolbox really free?',
    answer: 'Yes. All 23 tools are completely free with no usage limits, no watermarks, and no premium tier. We don\'t sell your data because we never collect it in the first place.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from other tool sites?',
    answer: 'Three ways: (1) Privacy — your data stays on your device. (2) Speed — no server round-trip means instant results. (3) Consistency — every tool follows the same 7-stage lifecycle with predictable UX.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Toolbox offline?',
    answer: 'After the first visit, the platform is cached by your browser via a service worker. Most tools will work offline. We\'re working on full PWA support for offline tool execution.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What browsers are supported?',
    answer: 'Toolbox works on all modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest 2 versions). Some tools use advanced Web APIs that may not be available in older browsers.',
  },
